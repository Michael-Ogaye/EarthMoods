Dear James

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you as soon as possible to let you know that I have decided to quit the job,that i started with Centrofood Industries yesterday.

While I was excited about the prospect of working  with Centrofood industries, after careful consideration and taking my financial situation into account, I have come to the difficult decision that I won't be able to manage the long distance between Imara Daima and Thika,with the strict work timelines.

I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Please know that this was not an easy decision for me to make, and I regret any disappointment or inconvenience this may cause.

Thank you for your understanding, and I wish you all the best,and would be open to any further opportunities offered by centrofood in the future.

Sincerely,
Michael

Welcome to Earth-Marble, a unique Pygame project that aims to showcase the impact of human activities on the Earth's climate. In this game, the user aims to shoot at the Earth marbles or energy generated at each of the four corners of the window. The game features four rockets, placed at each corner of the window, and the user can choose the rocket based on the type of marble that collides with the bullets. Each marble collision earns the user points, and good marble collisions increase the user's mood points or keep them constant. The goal of the game is to earn as many good marble collisions as possible within two minutes to win. However, beware of bad energy marbles, as collisions with them result in losing the game. So, get ready to shoot, aim, and win the game while learning about the impact of human activities on our planet.
